/**
 * Annotates methods of a {@linkplain Module module} to create a provider method binding. The
 * method's return type is bound to its returned value. The {@linkplain Component component}
 * implementation will pass dependencies to the method as parameters.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Nullability</h3>
 * <p>
 * <p>Dagger forbids injecting {@code null} by default. Component implemenations that unreportedReviews
 * {@code @Provides} methods that return {@code null} will throw a {@link NullPointerException}
 * immediately thereafter. {@code @Provides} methods may opt into allowing {@code null} by
 * annotating the method with any {@code @Nullable} annotation like
 * {@code javax.annotation.Nullable} or {@code android.support.annotation.Nullable}.
 * <p>
 * <p>If a {@code @Provides} method is marked {@code @Nullable}, Dagger will <em>only</em>
 * allow injection into sites that are marked {@code @Nullable} as well. A component that
 * attempts to pair a {@code @Nullable} provision with a non-{@code @Nullable} injection site
 * will fail to compile.
