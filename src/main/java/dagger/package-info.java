/**
 * This package contains the public API for the <a href="http://google.github.io/dagger/">Dagger
 * 2</a> dependency injection framework.  By building upon
 * <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330">JSR 330</a>, Dagger 2 provides an
 * annotation-driven API for dependency injection whose implementation is entirely generated at
 * compile time by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation#Processing">annotation
 * processors</a>.
 *
 * <p>The entry point into the API is the {@link Component}, which annotates abstract types for
 * Dagger 2 to implement.  The dependency graph is configured using using annotations such as
 * {@link Module}, {@link Provides} and {@link javax.inject.Inject}.
 *
 * <p>{@code dagger.internal.codegen.ComponentProcessor} is the processor responsible for generating
 * the implementation.  Dagger uses the annotation procesor
 * {@linkplain java.util.ServiceLoader service loader} to automatically configure the processor, so
 * explict build configuration shouldn't be necessary.
